Start mvn with -s path/to/this/file to pick up these settings, typically
it will be in the root of the container so "mvn -s devcontainer-settings.xml"

What it is for:

The dependency org.derecalliance.derec:derec-api:xxx is stored in
as a GitHub package. In order to access it you need to generate a PAT
with read permissions (no you can't set permissionless access).

This PAT then needs to be stored as a secret, which then
in turn needs to be made available to the dev container.

Step 1: Generate a PAT

You need to have created a PAT for access to a repo

Step 2: Make the PAT available as a secret for the repo using the library

Settings/Secrets and variables/codespaces

Save as PACKAGE_ACCESS_TOKEN, this is made available to codespace as an
environment variable, referenced below

-->
<settings>
	<servers>
		<server>
			<id>tbb-github</id>
			<username>nobody</username>
			<password>${env.PACKAGE_ACCESS_TOKEN}</password>
		</server>
	</servers>
</settings>
